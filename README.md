PyBot Simulator is an easy to use APCSP resource material to help students prepare for the APCSP exam. 
This simulator focuses on specifically robot questions where students will be asked to answer questions about where a robot will end up after running some code or some other relationship between a robot and code.
It incorporates combined syntax between the easy to use Python language and the pseudocode used in the APCSP exam. 
Users are able to type their own code into a textbox where they will be able to run functions that will allow a robot on the screen to move. 
Users can also select boxes on the robot's grid, which will turn that square into a wall. (meaning the robot will not be able to move inside that square)
Error messages will also pop up on the right hand side of the code editor box if there is an issue with the syntax.
The four main robot functions that users can run from the APCSP pseudocode are:
MOVE_FORWARD() - moves the robot forward one square depending on the direction it is facing
ROTATE_RIGHT() - rotates the robot right 90 degrees
ROTATE_LEFT() - rotates the robot left 90 degrees
CAN_MOVE(direction) - returns a boolean value (True or False) that depends on whether the robot can move in direction
direction -> "forward, backward, left, right"
Please refrain from typing in malicious code meant to harm the computer device / system used to run this simulator as any malicious imports or opening files will be blocked.
